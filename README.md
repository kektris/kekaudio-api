# KekAudio API
Addon for [KekAudio](https://github.com/kektris/kekaudio) that adds API support. It was very buggy and useless, so we thought it can be just as addon

![API info for track 1 on KekAudio RU](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8026e11-91b7-432c-94a3-a7773bf70aef)

# How to install
`git clone` this repo, and move __api__ folder to your KekAudio folder. Then, modify files for fitting with your uploaded tracks.

### If you have something to add, open pull request or issue.
